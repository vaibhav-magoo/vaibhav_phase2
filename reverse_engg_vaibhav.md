# 1. GDB babystep 1

> Can you figure out what is in the eax register at the end of the main function? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: picoCTF{n} where n is the contents of the eax register in the decimal number base. If the answer was 0x11 your flag would be picoCTF{17}.

## Solution:

- opened the file with .
- opened the main function
- had a hex value in the return statement
- turned it into decimal system


## Flag:

```
picoCTF{549698}
```

# 2. ARMssembly 1

> For what argument does this program print `win` with variables 68, 2 and 3? File: chall_1.S Flag format: picoCTF{XXXXXXXX} -> (hex, lowercase, no 0x, and 32 bits. ex. 5614267 would be picoCTF{0055aabb}

## Solution:

- Include as many steps as you can with your thought process
- You **must** include images such as screenshots wherever relevant.

```
put codes & terminal outputs here using triple backticks

you may also use ```python for python codes for example
```

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{}
```
