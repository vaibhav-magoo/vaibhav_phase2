## Solution:

- looked into serverside template injection
- gave a few ssti payloads i found online
- figured out that it was jinja
- found a payload to run linux commands
 ```
  {{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('id').read()}}
 ```
- then used 'ls' to list files
- and found a file called flag

3. Web Gauntlet

>Can you beat the filters? Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## Solution:

- opened the website and filter.php
- first filter was OR so used admin' --
- to bypass the second filter I used admin'/* since '-' was a filter
- used the same payload for the next one
- the admin was filtered out so used string concatination and put ad'||'min'/*
- used the same for the next one
- got the flag
